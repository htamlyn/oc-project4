# Optimisation Report for GoMike Designs

## Intro
As discussed, I have completed an audit and optimisation of the home and contact pages of the site, focusing on accessibility and SEO improvements. I also corrected a few coding errors as well. This report will cover the results of the inital audit and Lighthouse report, document all changes made to the code and the improvements shown in the secondary Lighthouse report.

## Initial Audit
